# Eye_Blink_detector
A simple Eye Blink Detector using Open CV and python 

It uses the cascade files to first detect the face and then uses the eye cascade face classifier to detect the eyes 

Then I calculated the ratio of the width and heigth of the eye detected so that it can detect eye blink

If I have not done that it could have detect the blink if the eye is at a some more far distance from the camera

so calculating the ratio of width and height of the eye results in a proper and accurate eye blink 

Thank You!!!!!!
